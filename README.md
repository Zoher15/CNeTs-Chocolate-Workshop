**Takeaway:** Milk chocolates are usually the crowd-pleasers, and it seems like they lived up to the hype—mostly.

Brands like Tony's Chocolonely (40-50%) and Ghirardelli seem to have hit the mark for more people, but some of the other dark chocolates didn’t manage to woo the crowd as easily. Maybe they weren’t “dark” enough for true dark chocolate fans?

One standout in the ratings was **Tony’s Chocolonely**, which consistently scored highly across different categories. But there’s more to Tony’s than great taste—the company is on a mission to **[eradicate child labor and modern slavery from the cocoa industry](https://us.tonyschocolonely.com/en/our-promise)**.
